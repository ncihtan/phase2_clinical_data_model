Chr M	Mitochondrial DNA	Typically small, circular, intronless, and maternally inherited, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the multicopy deoxyribonucleic acid genome of mitochondria, intracellular organelles responsible for vital respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation reactions in higher eukaryotes. Replicated and transcribed by a separate enzymatic machinery from that of nuclear DNA, mtDNA encodes only a subset of mitochondrial functions. (NCI04)
Chr X	Chromosome X	The female sex chromosome, being the differential sex chromosome carried by half the male gametes and all female gametes in man and other male-heterogametic species.
Chr Y	Chromosome Y	The male sex chromosome, being the differential sex chromosome carried by half the male gametes and none of the female gametes in man and in some other male-heterogametic species in which the homologue of the X chromosome has been retained.
