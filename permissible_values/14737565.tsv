PERMITTED_VALUE	DESCRIPTION	DEFINITION
Targeted Molecular Therapy	Targeted Molecular Therapy	Cancer therapies designed to act upon specific molecules in metabolic pathways or processes involved in carcinogenesis, tumor growth, or tumor spread.
Immunotherapy	Immunotherapy	Therapy designed to induce changes in a patient's immune status in order to treat disease.
Hormone Therapy	Endocrine Therapy	Various treatment modalities that produce the desired therapeutic effect by means of change of hormone/hormones level.
Chemotherapy	Chemotherapy	The use of synthetic or naturally-occurring chemicals for the treatment of diseases.
External Beam Radiation Therapy	External Beam Radiation Therapy	A type of radiation therapy that uses a machine to aim high-energy rays at the cancer from outside of the body.
Stereotactic Radiosurgery	Stereotactic Radiosurgery	A type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position the patient and precisely give a single large dose of radiation to a tumor. It is used to treat brain tumors and other brain disorders that cannot be treated by regular surgery. It is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.
Surgical Procedure	Surgical Procedure	A diagnostic or treatment procedure performed by manual and/or instrumental means, often involving an incision and the removal or replacement of a diseased organ or tissue; of or relating to or involving or used in surgery or requiring or amenable to treatment by surgery.
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy	Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy	Stereotactic radiation therapy in which one or several maximum dose radiation treatments are delivered targeting cancers of the body, excluding the brain or spine.
Proton Beam Radiation Therapy	Proton Beam Radiation Therapy	A type of external beam radiation therapy using a beam of protons. It has the advantage of precisely localizing the radiation dose on the targeted tissue and avoiding damage to the healthy surrounding tissues.
Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy	IMRT	An advanced form of 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy
Low-Dose Rate Brachytherapy	Low-Dose Rate Brachytherapy	Internal radiation treatment that targets a cancerous tissue with low doses of radiation through the use of inserted temporary or permanent implants.
High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy	High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy	Internal radiation treatment that targets a cancerous tissue with accurate, high doses of radiation through the use of inserted temporary implants.
3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy	3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy	A process by which a dose of radiation is automatically shaped to closely conform to the entire volume of the tumor, so that surrounding normal tissue is spared and treatment toxicity is decreased.
Unknown	Unknown	Not known, observed, recorded; or reported as unknown by the data contributor.
Radiofrequency Ablation	None	A therapeutic procedure to eradicate or reduce small tumors using radiowaves to generate heat. The procedure is performed by the insertion of a thin needle through the skin and into a tumor, which is guided by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound. Electrical energy delivered through this needle (electrode) heats and destroys the tumor. This therapeutic option is widely utilized by patients that have inoperable cancers, or are unsuitable chemotherapy candidates.
Concurrent Chemoradiation	None	Treatment in which radiation therapy is administered at the same time as chemotherapy.
Pharmacotherapy	None	Treatment of disease through the use of drugs.
Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation	None	A clinical treatment in which HSC capable of reconstituting the immune system and blood production (hematopoiesis) are transferred from one genetically dissimilar individual to another. The donor and recipient may or may not be related. 2005
Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation	None	The transference of stem cells within the same individual.
Not Reported	None	Not provided or available.
Conventional Radiotherapy	None	A course of radiotherapy where minimal imaging support (i.e. X-rays films) is used to determine the positioning of radiotherapy.
Radiation Therapy	None	Treatment of a disease by means of exposure of the target or the whole body to radiation. Radiation therapy is often used as part of curative therapy and occasionally as a component of palliative treatment for cancer. Other uses include total body irradiation prior to transplantation.
Radiopharmaceutical	None	Treatment with an agent that contains a radioactive pharmaceutical agent.
Photon Beam Radiation Therapy	None	Radiation therapy using photon beam.
Brachytherapy	None	A type of radiation therapy in which radioactive material sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters is placed directly into or near a tumor.
Cellular Therapy	None	Utilization of specific cells, modified or not, for treatment of diseases. Donor lymphocyte infusion is a type of cellular therapy.
Stem Cell Transplant	None	A therapeutic procedure that involves the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, either with the patient as their own donor or from a donor to a patient. This can be used for treatment of malignant and non-malignant diseases.
Electron Beam Radiation Therapy	None	Radiation therapy using electron beam
Organ Transplantation	None	The transfer of an organ, organ part, or tissue from one body to another, for the purpose of replacing the recipient's damaged or failing organ with a working one from the donor. Donors can be living, or cadaveric (dead).
Palliative Care	None	Palliative care is the patient-and family-centered active holistic care of patients with advanced, progressive disease. Traditional models reflect abandonment of proactive treatment and a simultaneous increase in symptom control and comfort-related services, as a disease progressed in linear fashion through its course. Essential components of palliative care are: pain and symptom control, communication regarding treatment and alternatives, prognosis, and available services, rehabilitation services, care that addresses treatment and palliative concerns, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual needs, terminal care, support in bereavement. The goal of palliative care is an achievement of the best quality of life for patients and their families.
