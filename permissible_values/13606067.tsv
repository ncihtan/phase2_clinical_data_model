The peripheral blood blast count ranges from 20% to 30%.  RAEB-T used to be a subcategory of myelodysplastic syndromes in the past.  Recently, the term has been eliminated from the WHO based classification of myelodysplastic syndromes.  The reason is that the percentage of peripheral blood blasts required for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia has been reduced to 20%.  The elimination of the RAEB-T term by the WHO experts has created confusion and ongoing arguments.  Currently, according to WHO classification, the vast majority of RAEB-T cases are best classified as acute leukemias (acute leukemias with multilineage dysplasia following myelodysplastic syndrome).

Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma	None	A mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, characterized by systemic disease and a polymorphous infiltrate involving lymph nodes and extranodal sites.  The clinical course is typically aggressive.
Cystadenocarcinoma	None	A malignant cystic epithelial neoplasm arising from the glandular epithelium.  The malignant epithelial cells invade the stroma.  The cystic spaces contain serous or mucinous fluid.  Representative examples include ovarian and pancreatic cystadenocarcinomas.
Ampulla of Vater Pancreatobiliary Type Adenocarcinoma	None	An invasive adenocarcinoma that arises from the ampulla of Vater. It is characterized by the presence of malignant cells that resemble the malignant cells of the pancreatic ductal or extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas.
Angioleiomyoma	None	A benign, slow-growing neoplasm that arises from the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by the presence of well-differentiated smooth muscle cells which are arranged around numerous vessels.
Cystic Hygroma	None	A benign lymphatic neoplasm usually arising from the neck and characterized by cystic dilation of the lymphatic vessels.
Cystic Tumor of the Atrioventricular Node	None	A multicystic tumor arising in the inferior interatrial septum in the region of the atrioventricular node. The vast majority of patients present with complete heart block and a minority with partial heart block. Sudden death is reported in approximately 10% of the cases. It is a morphologically benign tumor composed of cuboidal, transitional, or squamoid cells. The cells may also show sebaceous differentiation and originate from the endoderm.
Ampullary Noninvasive Papillary Neoplasm, Pancreatobiliary Type	None	An exophytic, preinvasive, papillary epithelial neoplasm that arises from the ampulla of Vater.  Histologically it resembles the papillary neoplasms of the biliary tree.  This category includes neoplasms with low grade dysplasia and high grade dysplasia.
Anal Glands Adenocarcinoma	None	An anal adenocarcinoma arising from the epithelium of the anal glands.  The overlying anal mucosa does not show evidence of neoplastic changes.
Angiomatoid Fibrous Histiocytoma	None	A low malignant potential soft tissue neoplasm of uncertain differentiation.  It typically affects young patients, presenting as a slowly growing nodular or cystic tumor mass, most often in the subcutaneous tissues of the extremities.  Occasionally, patients have systemic symptoms (anemia, fever, and weight loss).  This tumor has a relatively good prognosis.  A minority of patients develop local recurrences.  Metastases are rare.
Dedifferentiated Chordoma	None	A high-grade malignant bone tumor arising from the remnants of the notochord. It is characterized by a lobulated growth pattern, myxoid stroma formation, the presence of physaliphorous cells, and a sarcomatous component.
Angiomyofibroblastoma	None	A benign myofibroblastic neoplasm, usually arising in the pelviperineal region.  It is characterized by the presence of neoplastic spindle to round cells, dilated thin walled vessels, and stromal edema.  Most patients present with painless circumscribed masses.
Angiomyosarcoma	None	A malignant smooth muscle neoplasm characterized by the presence of atypical spindle cells and formation of vascular channels.
Dentinogenic Ghost Cell Tumor	None	A benign but locally infiltrating neoplasm arising from tooth-forming tissues. It is more often intraosseous and less frequently extraosseous and occurs in the jaw. It is characterized by the presence of ameloblastoma-like epithelium, connective tissue stroma, ghost cells, and dysplastic dentin. Wide local resection is recommended for intraosseous neoplasms and enucleation for extraosseous neoplasms.
Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans	None	A low grade fibroblastic neoplasm presenting as a nodular cutaneous mass, most often on the trunk and the proximal extremities.  The tumor diffusely infiltrates the dermis and the subcutaneous tissues.  It is considered a locally aggressive neoplasm, which often recurs but rarely metastasizes.
Desmoid Fibromatosis	None	An insidious poorly circumscribed neoplasm arising from the deep soft tissues. It is characterized by the presence of elongated spindle-shaped fibroblasts, collagenous stroma formation, and an infiltrative growth pattern.
Desmoplastic Fibroma	None	A rare, benign, locally aggressive osteolytic neoplasm. It is characterized by the presence of a rich collagenous stroma and spindle cells with minimal cellular atypia.
Angiosarcoma	None	A malignant tumor arising from the endothelial cells of the blood vessels.  Microscopically, it is characterized by frequently open vascular anastomosing and branching channels.  The malignant cells that line the vascular channels are spindle or epithelioid and often display hyperchromatic nuclei.  Angiosarcomas most frequently occur in the skin and breast.  Patients with long-standing lymphedema are at increased risk of developing angiosarcoma. -- 2004
Desmoplastic Melanoma	None	A melanoma of the skin characterized by a proliferation of atypical spindled melanocytes in the dermis, in a background of abundant collagen. It usually presents as an amelanotic raised nodular lesion.
Anaplastic Astrocytoma	None	A diffusely infiltrating, WHO grade III astrocytoma with focal or dispersed anaplasia, and a marked proliferative potential. It may arise from a low-grade astrocytoma, but it can also be diagnosed at first biopsy, without indication of a less malignant precursor lesion. It has an intrinsic tendency for malignant progression to glioblastoma. (WHO)
Anaplastic Ganglioglioma	None	Anaplastic Ganglioglioma (WHO grade III) is a neuroepithelial neoplasm composed of neoplastic, mature ganglion cells and anaplastic glial cells. These anaplastic changes in the glial component and high MIB-1 and TP53 labelling indices may indicate aggressive behavior.  However, the correlation of histological anaplasia with clinical outcome is inconsistent. (Adapted from WHO.)
Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma	None	A peripheral (mature) T-cell lymphoma, consisting of usually large anaplastic, CD30 positive cells.  Majority of cases are positive for the anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK) protein.  The most frequently seen genetic alteration is a t(2;5) translocation.  Majority of patients present with advanced disease.  The most important prognostic indicator is ALK positivity, which has been associated with a favorable prognosis. (WHO, 2001)
Desmoplastic/Nodular Medulloblastoma	None	A medulloblastoma characterized by the presence of nodular, collagenous areas which do not contain reticulin, surrounded by hypercellular areas which contain an intercellular reticulin fiber network.
Differentiated Retinoblastoma	None	A retinoblastoma with well differentiated features. It often produces Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes or Homer-Wright rosettes. In some cases the tumor cells form fleurettes.
Apocrine Adenoma	None	A benign epithelial neoplasm arising from the apocrine sweat glands. Representative examples include tubular apocrine adenoma and external auditory canal ceruminous adenoma.
