Biopsy	Biopsy	The removal of tissue specimens or fluid from the living body for microscopic examination, performed to establish a diagnosis.
Blood Sample	Blood Sample	A small volume of blood removed for testing or storage.
Bone Marrow Aspirate	Bone Marrow Aspirate	Aspirate from bone marrow.
Core Biopsy	Core Biopsy	The removal of a tissue sample using a needle with a relatively large diameter, for microscopic examination.
Cystoscopy	Cystoscopy	Endoscopic examination of the urinary bladder or urethra.
Diagnostic Imaging	Diagnostic Imaging	Any method that uses a visual display of structural or functional patterns of organs or tissues for diagnostic evaluation.
Dilation and Curettage	Dilation and Curettage	A surgical scraping and removal of the inner lining of the uterus through direct dilation of the uterine cervix.
Enucleation	Enucleation	A surgical procedure by which tissue or an organ (usually containing a tumor) is removed without rupture from a specific anatomic site.
Excisional Biopsy	Excisional Biopsy	A surgical procedure in which an entire lesion is removed for microscopic examination.
Fine Needle Aspiration	Fine-Needle Aspiration	The removal of tissue or fluid with a thin needle for examination under a microscope.
Histopathology	Histopathology	The microscopic study of characteristic tissue abnormalities by employing various cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains.  -- 2004
Imaging Technique	Imaging	Any technology or method that aids in the visualization of any biological process, cell, tissue or organ for use in screening, diagnosis, surgical procedures or therapy.
Incisional Biopsy	Incisional Biopsy	A surgical procedure in which part of a lesion is removed for microscopic examination.
Laparoscopy	Laparoscopy	Laparoscopic examination of the abdominal cavity and its contents.
Laparotomy	Laparotomy	Creation of a surgical opening into the abdominal cavity.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study File	Magnetic Resonance Imaging	Imaging that uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field rather than x-rays to provide amazingly clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. The technique is valuable for the diagnosis of many pathologic conditions, including cancer, heart and vascular disease, stroke, and joint and musculoskeletal disorders.
Not Reported	Not Reported	Not provided or available.
Pap Smear	Papanicolaou Smear Procedure	A biospecimen collection and staining procedure in which secretions and superficial cells of the cervix are collected and stained with the Papanicolaou stain followed by microscopic examination to identify the presence of abnormal cells.
Pathologic Review	Pathologic Examination	An assessment of disease process to include cause, development, and/or structural and functional changes associated with the disease.
Physical Examination	Physical Examination	A systemic evaluation of the body and its functions using visual inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. The purpose is to determine the presence or absence of physical signs of disease or abnormality for an individual's health assessment.
Surgical Resection	Resection (including complete excisional biospy)	The surgical removal of an organ or a part of an organ.
Thoracentesis	Thoracentesis	The removal of excess fluid via needle puncture from the thoracic cavity.
Tumor Debulking	Debulking	The surgical removal of as much of a malignant tumor as is reasonably possible. This procedure increases the effectiveness of the subsequent administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
Ultrasound Guided Biopsy	Ultrasound-guided Biopsy	A biopsy procedure that uses an ultrasound imaging device to find an abnormal area of tissue and guide its removal for examination under a microscope.
Ultrasound Imaging	Ultrasonography	A technique in which high-frequency sound waves are bounced off internal organs and the echo pattern is converted into a 2 dimensional picture of the structures beneath the transducer.
Unknown	Unknown	Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.
