PERMITTED_VALUE	DESCRIPTION	DEFINITION
Biochemical evidence of disease without structural correlate	None	An indication that biochemical markers of a disease are present but morphological markers are absent.
Tumor Free	None	There is no evidence of a tumor in the individual.
Unknown	None	Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.
With Tumor	None	There is evidence of a tumor in an individual.
Not Reported	None	Not provided or available.
Not Applicable	None	Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.
Not Allowed To Collect	None	An indicator that specifies that a collection event was not permitted.
Distant Metastasis	None	A biological process that involves the transfer and growth of cancer cells from the site of the primary tumor. Relocation of malignant cells during metastasis can be restricted to movement within a specific tissue/organ or may entail migration to a distal locus within the body. This phenotype is a characteristic of all malignant tumors.
Localized Disease	None	A disease that is confined to a specific organ or tissue and has not spread to other anatomic sites.
Regional Disease	None	A disease or condition that extends beyond the site and spreads into adjacent tissues and regional lymph nodes.
New Tumor Event	None	The presence of a primary, recurrent or metastatic neoplasm which has not been previously noted.
