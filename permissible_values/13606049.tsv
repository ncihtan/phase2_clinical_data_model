It shows histopathological features reminiscent of ependymomas, including perivascular pseudorosettes and true rosettes. There is no evidence of necrosis or increased mitotic activity. Despite the presence of ependymal histopathological features, these neoplasms probably are not related to ependymomas. Their prognosis is unknown.
9391/3	Ependymoma	Ependymoma (WHO grade II) is the most common ependymal neoplasm. It is a slow growing tumor of children and young adults and is usually located intraventricularly.

It is predominantly composed of neoplastic astrocytes showing a small cell body with few, flaccid processes with a low content of glial filaments and scant GFAP expression.

When occurring in children, this neoplasm may be difficult to separate from Pilocytic Juvenile Astrocytoma. (Adapted from WHO.)
9411/3	Gemistocytic Astrocytoma	Gemistocytic Astrocytoma is a rare variant of Diffuse Astrocytoma. It is characterized by the presence of a conspicuous, though variable, fraction of gemistocytic neoplastic astrocytes. Gemistocytes are round to oval astrocytes with abundant, glassy, non-fibrillary cytoplasm which appears to displace the dark, angulated nucleus to the periphery of the cell. To make the diagnosis of Gemistocytic Astrocytoma, gemistocytes should amount to more than approximately 20% of all tumor cells. (Adapted from WHO.)

The occasional or regional occurrence of gemistocytic neoplastic cells is compatible with the diagnosis of fibrillary astrocytoma. (WHO)
9421/1	Pilocytic astrocytoma	Pilocytic Astrocytoma, the most common glioma in children, is a WHO grade I astrocytic tumor. It is a generally well circumscribed, slowly growing, often cystic, astrocytoma.

Patients often present with midfacial destructive lesions (lethal midline granuloma).  The disease may disseminate rapidly to various anatomic sites including gastrointestinal tract, skin, testis, and cervical lymph nodes.  It is also known as angiocentric T-cell lymphoma.  The term 'polymorphic reticulosis' has been widely used to describe the morphologic changes seen in this type of lymphoma.

9984/3	Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts in Transformation	Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) is characterised by dysplastic features of the myeloid and usually erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and an increased number of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood.  The peripheral blood blast count ranges from 20% to 30%.  RAEB-T used to be a subcategory of myelodysplastic syndromes in the past.  Recently, the term has been eliminated from the WHO based classification of myelodysplastic syndromes.  The reason is that the percentage of peripheral blood blasts required for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia has been reduced to 20%.  The elimination of the RAEB-T term by the WHO experts has created confusion and ongoing arguments.  Currently, according to WHO classification, the vast majority of RAEB-T cases are best classified as acute leukemias (acute leukemias with multilineage dysplasia following myelodysplastic syndrome).  A minority of cases are part of RAEB-2.

The peripheral blood shows macrocytic anemia.  This syndrome occurs predominantly but not exclusively in middle age to older women.  The prognosis is good and transformation to acute leukemia is rare.  (WHO, 2001)

9989/3	Myelodysplastic Syndrome	A clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in one or more of the hematopoietic cell lines. The dysplasia may be accompanied by an increase in myeloblasts, but the number is less than 20%, which, according to the WHO guidelines, is the requisite threshold for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. It may occur de novo or as a result of exposure to alkylating agents and/or radiotherapy. (WHO, 2001)
