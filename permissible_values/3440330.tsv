N1b	N1b Stage Finding	Breast cancer with metastasis in internal mammary lymph nodes with microscopic disease detected by sentinel lymph node dissection but not clinically apparent. (from AJCC 6th Ed.)
N1bI	N1bI Stage Finding	A regional lymph node TNM finding indicating that there is metastasis to 1-3 nodes.  The metastasis is greater than 2 mm and all are less than 20 mm.
N1bII	N1bII Stage Finding	A regional lymph node TNM finding indicating that there is metastasis to four or more nodes.  The metastasis is greater than 2 mm and all are less than 20 mm.
N1bIII	N1bIII Stage Finding	A regional lymph node TNM finding indicating that the tumor extends beyond the lymph node capsule and is less than 20 mm.

N1mi	N1mi Stage Finding	Breast cancer with micrometastases (greater than 0.2 mm and/or more than 200 cells, but none greater than 2.0 mm) (from AJCC 7th Ed.)
N2	N2 Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in several regional lymph nodes. The definition of N2 TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for breast cancer it refers to metastases in 4-9 axillary lymph nodes; for cutaneous melanoma it refers to metastases in 2-3 regional lymph nodes; for colorectal cancer it refers to metastases in 4 or more regional lymph nodes; and for bladder cancer it refers to metastases in multiple regional lymph nodes in the true pelvis.
N2a	N2a Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in several regional lymph nodes.  The definition of N2a TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for breast cancer it refers to metastases in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0 mm); for cutaneous melanoma it refers to micrometastases in 2-3 regional lymph nodes; for colorectal cancer it refers to metastases in 4-6 regional lymph nodes.
N2b	N2b Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in several regional lymph nodes.  The definition of N2b TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for breast cancer it refers to metastases only in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary nodes and in the absence of clinically evident level I, II axillary lymph node metastases; for cutaneous melanoma it refers to macrometastases in 2-3 regional lymph nodes; for colorectal cancer it refers to metastases in seven or more regional lymph nodes.
N2c	N2c Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in several regional lymph nodes.  The definition of N2c TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for cutaneous melanoma it refers to intralymphatic metastases (in transit or satellite metastases) without metastatic nodes; for lip and oral cavity cancer it refers to metastases in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
N3	N3 Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in multiple lymph nodes. The definition of N3 TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for breast cancer it refers to metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; for cutaneous melanoma it refers to metastases in 4 or more regional lymph nodes; for gastric cancer it refers to metastases in 7 or more regional lymph nodes; and for bladder cancer it refers to metastases in common iliac lymph nodes.
N3a	N3a Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in multiple lymph nodes.  The definition of N3a TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for breast cancer it refers to metastases in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes (at least one tumor deposit greater than 2.0 mm) or metastases to the infraclavicular (level III axillary) lymph nodes; for gastric cancer it refers to metastases in 7-15 regional lymph nodes; for nasopharyngeal cancer it refers to metastases to one or more lymph nodes greater than 6 cm in greatest dimension.
N3b	N3b Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in multiple lymph nodes.  The definition of N3b TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for breast cancer it refers to metastases in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes in the presence of  one or more positive axillary lymph nodes, or in more than 3 axillary lymph nodes and in internal mammary lymph nodes with micrometastases or macrometastases detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy but not clinically detected; for gastric cancer it refers to metastases in sixteen or more regional lymph nodes; for nasopharyngeal cancer it refers to extension to the supraclavicular fossa.
N3c	N3c Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in multiple lymph nodes.  The definition of N3c TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for breast cancer it refers to metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes.
N4	N4 Stage Finding	A general term that refers to a TNM finding of cancer metastases in multiple lymph nodes. The definition of N4 TNM finding depends on the specific type of cancer that it refers to; for example, for ocular adnexal lymphoma it refers to metastases to central lymph nodes.
