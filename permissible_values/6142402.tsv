PERMITTED_VALUE	LONG_NAME	DEFINITION
Alleles	Allele	Mutually exclusive alternative forms of the same gene occupying the same locus on homologous chromosomes, differing in nucleotide sequence and governing the same biochemical and developmental process.
Amplification	Gene Amplification Abnormality	An increase in the copy number of a particular gene. This type of abnormality can be either inherited or somatic.
Chimerism	Chimerism	The occurrence in an individual of two or more cell populations of different chromosomal constitutions, derived from different individuals. This contrasts with mosaicism in which the different cell populations are derived from a single individual.
Chromosomal Gain	Chromosomal Gain	A cytogenetic abnormality that refers to gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosome arm or a chromosomal band.
Chromosomal Loss	Chromosomal Loss	Loss of an entire chromosome or chromosome arm.
Conversion	Conversion Mutation	The act of changing the nature, form, function, or purpose of something to another.: Any transmissible change in the genetic material of an organism, which can result from radiation, viral infection, transposition, treatment with mutagenic chemicals and errors during DNA replication or meiosis. The effects of mutation range from single base changes to loss or gain of complete chromosomes. As many of the simpler alterations to DNA may be repaired, such changes are only heritable once the change is fixed in the DNA by the process of replication. Mutations may be associated with genetic diversity or with pathologies including cancer.
Deletion	Deletion Mutation	A loss of any genetic material on a chromosome, ranging from loss of a single nucleotide, to loss of part or all of a gene, to loss of a visible portion of the chromosome involving multiple genes. Deletions often disrupt gene or protein function and cell function as a result.
Deletion-insertion	Deletion-Insertion Mutation	Any rearrangement to the genomic content that results in the loss of one or more nucleotides of DNA. Deletions are generally irreversible rearrangements. They may alter the reading frame of a gene, or may result in loss of large chromosomal regions.: An article used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives; used to connect alternative terms for the same thing; used in correlation; used to correct or rephrase what was previously said; otherwise.: Any rearrangement to the genomic content that adds one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. Insertions may be reversible, particulary if caused by transposable elements. They may alter the reading frame of a gene, or may cause large scale additions of genomic DNA.
Duplication	Gene Duplication Abnormality	Generation of an extra copy of a particular gene in the genome. A gene duplication abnormality may occur by gene amplification, random breakage and reunion, retrotransposition or unequal crossing-over at meiosis. A gene duplication abnormality can be either heritable or somatic.
Extension	Extension Mutation	To increase in length or duration.: Any transmissible change in the genetic material of an organism, which can result from radiation, viral infection, transposition, treatment with mutagenic chemicals and errors during DNA replication or meiosis. The effects of mutation range from single base changes to loss or gain of complete chromosomes. As many of the simpler alterations to DNA may be repaired, such changes are only heritable once the change is fixed in the DNA by the process of replication. Mutations may be associated with genetic diversity or with pathologies including cancer.
Hypermethylation	Hypermethylation	Hypermethylation appears to be a controlled, epigenetic, heritable, and aberrant DNA methylation reaction on gene promoter regions and CpG islands associated with loss of (e.g., tumor-suppressor) gene function in diverse cellular pathways through transcriptional silencing by the formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin.
Insertion	Insertion Mutation	Mutations that result in the insertion of one or more nucleotides into a wild type DNA sequence.  Can result in a frame shift in the coding sequence of a gene.
Inversion	Inversion Mutation	A structural change in genomic DNA where the 5' to 3' order of a nucleotide sequence is completely reversed to the 3' to 5' order relative to its adjacent sequences. This inversion is termed either pericentric, if it includes the centromere of a chromosome, or pancentric, if it excludes the centromere. An inversion mutation abnormality may be heritable or occur somatically.
Methylation	Methylation	The covalent chemical or biochemical addition of a methyl group(s) to a compound. (NCI)
Mosaicism	Mosaicism	The presence of more than one genetically distinct cell line in germ and/or somatic cells.
Not Reported	Not Reported	Not provided or available.
Other	Other	Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.
Partial methylation	Partial Methylation	Being or affecting only a part of something.: The covalent chemical or biochemical addition of a methyl group(s) to a compound. (NCI)
Rearrangement	DNA Sequence Rearrangement	Any process affecting a DNA sequence that results in the gain, loss or exchange of DNA between chromosomes and/or autonomous replicons.
Repeated sequences	Repeated Sequences	Make or do or perform again.: The sequence of nucleotide residues along a DNA chain.
Splice	Splice-Site Mutation	A mutation that alters or abolishes the specific sequence denoting the site at which the splicing of an intron takes place. Such mutations may result in one or more introns remaining in the mature messenger RNA or fusion of non-adjacent exons and can disrupt the generation of the protein product.
Substitution	Substitution Mutation	The act of putting one thing or person in the place of another.: Any transmissible change in the genetic material of an organism, which can result from radiation, viral infection, transposition, treatment with mutagenic chemicals and errors during DNA replication or meiosis. The effects of mutation range from single base changes to loss or gain of complete chromosomes. As many of the simpler alterations to DNA may be repaired, such changes are only heritable once the change is fixed in the DNA by the process of replication. Mutations may be associated with genetic diversity or with pathologies including cancer.
Translocation	Translocation Mutation	The movement of a physical object from one place to another. (NCI): Any transmissible change in the genetic material of an organism, which can result from radiation, viral infection, transposition, treatment with mutagenic chemicals and errors during DNA replication or meiosis. The effects of mutation range from single base changes to loss or gain of complete chromosomes. As many of the simpler alterations to DNA may be repaired, such changes are only heritable once the change is fixed in the DNA by the process of replication. Mutations may be associated with genetic diversity or with pathologies including cancer.
Unknown	Unknown	Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.
