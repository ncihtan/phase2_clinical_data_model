NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) provides controlled terminology for clinical care, translational and basic research, public dissemination of information and associated administrative activities. NCIt is updated monthly to support precise coding of data based on the most recent developments in the cancer and biomedical research community.  NCIt has rich textual and formal logic descriptions of biomedical concepts, including full text definitions, synonyms, a true is_a taxonomic structure, polyhierarchy, inferred partonomy, and other features that make it suitable for supporting accurate human understanding and complex computer processing.  NCIt has been produced by NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) since 1997, and adopted since then for use by numerous federal agencies, standards development and research organizations._Any natural, endogenously-derived, synthetic or semi-synthetic compound with pharmacologic activity. A pharmacologic substance has one or more specific mechanism of action(s) through which it exerts one or more effect(s) on the human or animal body. They can be used to potentially prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease. Formulation specific agents and some combination agents are also classified as pharmacologic substances.
