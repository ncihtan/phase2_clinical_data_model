PERMITTED_VALUE	DESCRIPTION	DEFINITION
Complete Remission/Response	Complete Remission	The disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment.  This does not always mean the cancer has been cured.
Persistent Disease	Persistent disease (Hematologic persistence)	A disease that does not go to remission despite treatment.
Not Applicable	Not Applicable	Determination that a value is not relevant in the current context.
Partial Remission/Response	Partial Remission	A decrease in the size of a tumor, or in the extent of cancer in the body, in response to treatment.
Progressive Disease	Progressive Disease	A clinical, pathologic, and/or molecular finding indicating that the course of a disease is worsening in terms of extent or severity.
Stable Disease	Stable Disease	Cancer that is neither decreasing nor increasing in extent or severity.
Unknown	Unknown	Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.
Progressive Tumor Mass and Tumor Markers	Progressive Tumor Mass and Tumor Markers	Advancing in extent or severity.: A benign or malignant tissue growth resulting from uncontrolled cell proliferation. Benign neoplastic cells resemble normal cells without exhibiting significant cytologic atypia, while malignant cells exhibit overt signs such as dysplastic features, atypical mitotic figures, necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism, and anaplasia. Representative examples of benign neoplasms include papillomas, cystadenomas, and lipomas; malignant neoplasms include carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias.: A benign or malignant pathologic structure in any part of the body, resulting from a neoplastic accumulation of cells, inflammatory cells, or cystic changes.: A substance that may be found in tumor tissue or released from a tumor into the blood or other body fluids. A high level of a tumor marker may mean that a certain type of cancer is in the body. Examples of tumor markers include CA 125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in ovarian, lung, breast, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract cancers), and PSA (in prostate cancer).: An observation confirming something, such as the presence of a disease, condition, or microorganism.: Cancer that is increasing in scope or severity.
Normalization of Tumor Markers, but Residual Tumor Mass	Normalization of Tumor Markers, but Residual Tumor Mass	A substance that may be found in tumor tissue or released from a tumor into the blood or other body fluids. A high level of a tumor marker may mean that a certain type of cancer is in the body. Examples of tumor markers include CA 125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in ovarian, lung, breast, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract cancers), and PSA (in prostate cancer).: Being approximately average or within certain limits; conforming with or constituting a norm or standard or level or type or social norm.: Cancer cells that remain after attempts to remove the cancer have been made.: Being or existing in a specified place or at the specified time.: A finding indicating that there is a decrease in the size and the extent of tissue involvement by a malignant tumor in a patient.
No Measureable Tumor or Tumor Markers	No Measureable Tumor or Tumor Markers	Capable of being measured.: A benign or malignant tissue growth resulting from uncontrolled cell proliferation. Benign neoplastic cells resemble normal cells without exhibiting significant cytologic atypia, while malignant cells exhibit overt signs such as dysplastic features, atypical mitotic figures, necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism, and anaplasia. Representative examples of benign neoplasms include papillomas, cystadenomas, and lipomas; malignant neoplasms include carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias.: Not existing in a specified place at a specified time.: A substance that may be found in tumor tissue or released from a tumor into the blood or other body fluids. A high level of a tumor marker may mean that a certain type of cancer is in the body. Examples of tumor markers include CA 125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in ovarian, lung, breast, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract cancers), and PSA (in prostate cancer).: A finding of normality following an examination or investigation looking for the presence of a microorganism, disease, or condition.: The disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment.
Elevated Tumor Markers and Residual Mass	Elevated Tumor Markers and Residual Mass	Raised or increased above normal levels or limits.: A substance that may be found in tumor tissue or released from a tumor into the blood or other body fluids. A high level of a tumor marker may mean that a certain type of cancer is in the body. Examples of tumor markers include CA 125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in ovarian, lung, breast, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract cancers), and PSA (in prostate cancer).: Remaining or left behind.: A benign or malignant pathologic structure in any part of the body, resulting from a neoplastic accumulation of cells, inflammatory cells, or cystic changes.: A disease that does not go to remission despite treatment.
Treatment Ongoing	Treatment Still in Progress	Remain in force or carry on without letup; keep or maintain in unaltered condition; exist in time or space without stop or interruption.: An action or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter or stop a pathologic process.
First Course Treatment Still in Progress	First Course Treatment Still in Progress	Preceding all others in time or space or degree.: Passage through time; duration; a systematic or/and orderly succession; a sequence, e.g. course of treatment; a mode of action or behavior; natural development, typical manner of proceeding.: Remain in force or carry on without letup; keep or maintain in unaltered condition; exist in time or space without stop or interruption.: An action or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter or stop a pathologic process.
Treatment Stopped Due to Toxicity	Treatment Terminated Due to Toxicity	Indicates that the patient terminated the treatment due to toxicity related to the treatment.
Other	Other	Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.
Partial Response	Partial Response	Partial; being or affecting only a part; not total: In medicine, an improvement related to treatment.
Complete Response	Complete Response	To possess every necessary or normal part or component or step; having come or been brought to a conclusion.: Any act or phenomena, or behavior, constituting a reply or reaction of a living organism or its part to some foregoing stimulus or agent.
No Response	No Response	No apparent change or worsening in tumor staging classification.
Mixed Response	Mixed response	Involving or composed of different kinds.: The pathologic and/or clinical changes that result from treatment. The changes may include eradication of detectable disease, stabilization of disease, or disease progression.
Very Good Partial Response	Very good Partial Response	Partial response with additional serum and urine M-protein reduction, but not meeting complete response.
No Measurable Disease	None	An absence of quantifiable or detectable disease.
Not Reported	None	Not provided or available.
